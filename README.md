# Rubik's Cube Solver

A simple web-based Rubik's Cube simulator built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that:

* Represents a Rubik's Cube using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Allows face rotations (clockwise & anticlockwise)
* Scrambles the cube with random moves
* Solves it with a placeholder algorithm
* Tracks and displays each step
* Visually displays a face of the cube using color tiles

## 🧠 Features Implemented

| Feature                         |
| ------------------------------- | 
| OOP-based cube representation   | 
| Manual rotation of faces        | 
| Scramble function               |
| Dummy solve algorithm           | 
| Step tracking                   | 
| Colored visual display (U face) | 
| CSS Responsive UI               |

## 📸 Preview

The cube is represented as a 3x3 grid (currently only the U face is shown):

```
⬜ 🟩 🔴
🟦 🟨 🟧
🟧 🔴 ⬜
```

Each color represents a different face of the Rubik's cube:

* White: U (Up)
* Yellow: D (Down)
* Green: F (Front)
* Blue: B (Back)
* Orange: L (Left)
* Red: R (Right)

## 🛠️ Future Enhancements

* Add full 6-face rendering using CSS Grid or Canvas
* Implement real solving algorithm (e.g., Layer-by-Layer or Beginner's Method)
* Animate cube rotation
